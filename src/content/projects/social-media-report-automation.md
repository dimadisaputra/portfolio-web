## Project Overview

The **Social Media Report Automation** project automates the entire reporting process from social media data analysis to visual and narrative generation.  
Starting from relevance-filtered and sentiment-analyzed social media datasets (exported as CSV), the system automatically generates a comprehensive report in **Google Docs or Google Slides**, complete with visuals and AI-generated text.

The goal is to drastically reduce the time spent on manual reporting by automatically producing visual charts, narrative insights, and structured summaries ready for review.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Automated Report Generation**: Developed a system to transform preprocessed social media data into formatted Google Docs or Slides reports using the **Google Workspace API**.
- **Data Visualization**: Generated dynamic visualizations — including **pie charts, bar charts, word clouds, timelines, and social network analysis (SNA)** — using Python visualization libraries.
- **AI Narrative Generation**: Integrated **OpenAI API** to automatically write report narratives, such as summarizing post topics and analyzing audience responses.
- **Data Processing**: Built preprocessing steps to clean and aggregate social media sentiment and relevance data from CSV files.
- **Workflow Automation**: Designed the system to run manually or via **cron jobs** for scheduled automatic reporting.

## Current Status

The system has been fully developed and can generate complete analytical reports — from CSV data to finalized Google Docs or Slides — including both **visual elements and AI-generated narratives**.  
Currently, execution is done manually, but the design supports automated scheduling via cron for full hands-off operation.

## Future Plans

- **Full Workflow Automation**: Integrate the process with a scheduling or orchestration system (e.g., Prefect or Airflow) for end-to-end automation.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard to select datasets, customize visuals, and trigger report generation with a single click.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Workspace API (Docs & Slides)
- OpenAI API
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Cron (for optional automation)

## Highlights & Learnings

- Gained experience integrating **AI text generation with automated document creation** workflows.  
- Improved skills in **data storytelling**, combining visuals and narratives for impactful reporting.  
- Learned practical implementation of **Google Workspace automation** for business intelligence use cases.  
- Optimized workflow design for potential future **ETL and scheduling** integration.
